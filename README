Code for testing bitcoin implementations by communicating with them
via the bitcoin network protocol.

The intent is to create test suites for both regression testing the original
bitcoin implementation and for testing new implementations, with an
emphasis on tests of edge cases that could cause inadvertent block chain
splits.

UNDER CONSTRUCTION...  expect misleading comments and half-baked code.
